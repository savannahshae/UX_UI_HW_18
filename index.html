            <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>Interaction design is the process of designing digital products or interfaces with a focus on how users interact with them. It involves creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that allow users to easily navigate and accomplish their goals. Interaction design takes into consideration the context in which users will be using the product, as well as their expectations and mental models. By designing with a focus on interaction, designers can create engaging and enjoyable experiences for users, improving the overall usability and effectiveness of the product.</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>User research is an integral part of UX design that involves gathering insights and feedback from potential users of a product or service. This research can take many forms, including surveys, interviews, usability testing, and analytics data analysis. The goal of user research is to gain a deeper understanding of users' needs, behaviors, and preferences, and to use that information to inform the design process. By conducting user research, UX designers can identify pain points, validate assumptions, and create a more effective and user-friendly product that meets the needs of its target audience.</p>

            <h3>Prototyping with Figma</h3>
            <p>Figma is a powerful tool for prototyping in UX design, allowing designers to create interactive mockups and test user flows before development. It starts with creating wireframes or low-fidelity mockups of your design ideas. Once you have a basic layout, you can begin to add interactive elements such as buttons, dropdown menus, and hover effects. Next, use Figma's prototyping tools to create clickable links and simulate user flows through the design. This will allow you to test the design with users and gather feedback on how they interact with the interface. Use this feedback to iterate on the design and improve the user experience.</p>
